Yes, it will run. Since your Jupyter is already connected to Spark through Hadoop, the spark variable should already exist in your environment.
One suggestion - break it into cells so you can run step by step and catch any issues early:
Cell 1:
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
from collections import Counter
Cell 2:
# Read client list
client_list = spark.read.csv(
    "/user/427966379/VVD_SRF_LIST.csv",
    header=True
).select("CLNT_NO").distinct()

print(f"Clients in list: {client_list.count()}")
Cell 3:
# Read UCP4 and filter
ucp4_data = spark.read.parquet(
    "/prod/sz/tsz/00172/data/ucp4/MONTH_END_DATE=2025-11-30"
)

filtered_ucp4 = ucp4_data.join(
    broadcast(client_list),
    on="CLNT_NO",
    how="inner"
)

print(f"Matched records: {filtered_ucp4.count()}")
print(f"Total columns: {len(filtered_ucp4.columns)}")
Cell 4:
# Column breakdown by type
type_counts = Counter([dtype for name, dtype in filtered_ucp4.dtypes])
print("Columns by type:")
for dtype, count in type_counts.items():
    print(f"  {dtype}: {count}")
Cell 5:
# View sample
filtered_ucp4.show(10, truncate=False)
This way if something breaks, you'll know exactly where.
