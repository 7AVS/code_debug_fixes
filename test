Got it. Let me create a set of PROC SQL queries for your EDA on the LN_OPENED table:
/* 1. Distribution of LOAN_CATEGORY by STATUS */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE loan_category_status AS
    SELECT 
        LOAN_CATEGORY,
        STATUS,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans,
        SUM(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS total_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR20.2,
        MEAN(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS avg_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR12.2
    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY LOAN_CATEGORY, STATUS
    ORDER BY LOAN_CATEGORY, STATUS;
QUIT;

/* 2. Overall LOAN_CATEGORY distribution */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE loan_category_summary AS
    SELECT 
        LOAN_CATEGORY,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CLNT_NO) AS n_clients,
        SUM(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS total_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR20.2,
        MEAN(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS avg_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR12.2,
        MEDIAN(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS median_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR12.2
    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY LOAN_CATEGORY
    ORDER BY n_loans DESC;
QUIT;

/* 3. Delinquency by STATUS - Understanding the relationship */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE delinq_status AS
    SELECT 
        STATUS,
        DFR_PYMT_IND,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans,
        CALCULATED n_loans / SUM(CALCULATED n_loans) AS pct_of_status FORMAT=PERCENT8.2
    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY STATUS, DFR_PYMT_IND
    ORDER BY STATUS, DFR_PYMT_IND;

/* 4. Delinquency by LOAN_CATEGORY and STATUS */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE delinq_category_status AS
    SELECT 
        LOAN_CATEGORY,
        STATUS,
        DFR_PYMT_IND,

    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY LOAN_CATEGORY, STATUS, DFR_PYMT_IND
    ORDER BY LOAN_CATEGORY, STATUS, DFR_PYMT_IND;

/* 5. Guarantee Amount (GUAR_AMT) analysis */
PROC SQL;

        LOAN_CATEGORY,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans,
        SUM(CASE WHEN GUAR_AMT > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS n_guaranteed,
        CALCULATED n_guaranteed / CALCULATED n_loans AS pct_guaranteed FORMAT=PERCENT8.2,
        SUM(GUAR_AMT) AS total_guar_amt FORMAT=DOLLAR20.2,
        MEAN(GUAR_AMT) AS avg_guar_amt FORMAT=DOLLAR12.2,
        SUM(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS total_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR20.2,
        CALCULATED total_guar_amt / CALCULATED total_authorized AS guar_to_auth_ratio FORMAT=PERCENT8.2
    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY LOAN_CATEGORY
    ORDER BY n_loans DESC;
QUIT;

/* 6. LOAN_TYPE distribution */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE loan_type_summary AS
    SELECT 
        LOAN_TYPE,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CLNT_NO) AS n_clients,

    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY LOAN_TYPE
    ORDER BY n_loans DESC;

/* 7. STATUS distribution overall */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE status_summary AS
    SELECT 
        STATUS,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CLNT_NO) AS n_clients,
        SUM(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS total_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR20.2,
        MEAN(AUTHORIZED_AMT) AS avg_authorized FORMAT=DOLLAR12.2
    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY STATUS
    ORDER BY n_loans DESC;
QUIT;

/* 8. Client-level summary - Multiple loans per client */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE client_loan_counts AS
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT CLNT_NO) AS total_clients,
        SUM(CASE WHEN loan_count = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clients_1_loan,
        SUM(CASE WHEN loan_count = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clients_2_loans,
        SUM(CASE WHEN loan_count >= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clients_3plus_loans
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            CLNT_NO,
            COUNT(*) AS loan_count
        FROM LN_OPENED
        GROUP BY CLNT_NO
    );
QUIT;

/* 9. Cross-tab: LOAN_CATEGORY by LOAN_TYPE */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE category_type_cross AS
    SELECT 
        LOAN_CATEGORY,
        LOAN_TYPE,
        COUNT(*) AS n_loans
    FROM LN_OPENED
    GROUP BY LOAN_CATEGORY, LOAN_TYPE
    ORDER BY LOAN_CATEGORY, n_loans DESC;

/* Print all results */
PROC PRINT DATA=loan_category_status; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=loan_category_summary; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=delinq_status; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=delinq_category_status; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=guarantee_summary; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=loan_type_summary; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=status_summary; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=client_loan_counts; RUN;
PROC PRINT DATA=category_type_cross; RUN;
These queries will give you:
Loan category by status - see which categories are open/closed
Overall category summary - volumes, client counts, $ amounts
Delinquency by status - does DFR_PYMT_IND work across all statuses?
Delinquency detail - broken down by category and status
Guarantee analysis - how many loans are guaranteed, what's the coverage ratio
Loan type distribution
Status summary
Client-level - how many clients have multiple loans
Category × Type crosstab - understand the relationship
Run these and let me know what you see - we can drill deeper based on the results.
